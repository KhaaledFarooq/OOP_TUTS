1. Interface has a private method called solve; Interfaces are not allowed to have private
methods without method bodies.
2. Print formula method has a method implementation in the interface. Interface cannot have
public methods with bodies.
3. The method printFormula() is not implemented in LinearEquation class. When a class is
implementing a interface it should implement all the methods found in that interface.
4. All fields inherited from the interface are static and final therefore the method solve()
cannot change the value of numberOfVariables.
