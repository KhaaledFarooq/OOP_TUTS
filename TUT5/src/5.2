TinyCell2 will call the constructor of its parent class Cell2. Since there is already and constructor with
parameters the compiler will not create a default no argument constructor for Cell2 and this will cause and error.
However by n adding Super(5) will make TinyCell2 call the Cell2(int) constructor and the program will run.
